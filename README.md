## Dataset

CO2 Emissions_Canada.csv – This is the dataset that is used by the code files in this repository to train and evaluate the deep learning models predicting vehicle CO₂ emissions.

This dataset was originally published on the website Kaggle.

##  Code
- ParentPaper_Code.ipynb – This notebook reproduces the analysis and modeling workflow from the original paper. It includes data cleaning, feature selection, and machine learning model for CO₂ emissions prediction using vehicle data.

- Modification.ipynb – This notebook expands on the original paper by implementing LSTM and BiLSTM models using TensorFlow/Keras in Python. It reshapes the dataset into a sequential format and evaluates model performance using additional metrics like Pearson correlation and RMSE, and neural network
