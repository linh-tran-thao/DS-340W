## Dataset

CO2 Emissions_Canada.csv ‚Äì This is the dataset that is used by the code files in this repository to train and evaluate the deep learning models predicting vehicle CO‚ÇÇ emissions.

This dataset was originally published on the website Kaggle.

Table

Column | Description
Model | Vehicle drive or body type (e.g., 4WD, AWD, FFV, SWB, LWB, EWB)
Engine Size (L) | Engine displacement in liters
Cylinders | Number of engine cylinders
Transmission | Transmission type: A = Automatic AM = Automated Manual AS = Automatic with Select Shift AV = Continuously Variable M = Manual 3‚Äì10 = Gear count
Fuel Type | X = Regular Gasoline Z = Premium Gasoline D = Diesel E = Ethanol (E85) N = Natural Gas
Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km) | Fuel used per 100 km in city driving
Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km) | Fuel used per 100 km in highway driving
Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km) | Combined fuel consumption (55% city, 45% highway)
Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg) | Combined fuel consumption in miles per imperial gallon
CO2 Emissions (g/km) | Tailpipe CO‚ÇÇ emissions for combined driving

##  Code
- ParentPaper_Code.ipynb ‚Äì This notebook reproduces the analysis and modeling workflow from the original paper. It includes data cleaning, feature selection, and machine learning model for CO‚ÇÇ emissions prediction using vehicle data.

## Novelty Ideas
üîç Quantile Regression: Predicts a range of possible CO‚ÇÇ emission values, capturing uncertainty instead of just a single estimate.

üö® Super-Polluter Detection: Identifies the top 5% of highest-emitting vehicles using a classification model for targeted action.

üß© K-Means Clustering: Segments vehicles by emission behavior, revealing patterns across engine size, fuel type, and efficiency.

- Final_Modification.ipynb ‚Äì This notebook expands on the original paper with novelty ideas.
